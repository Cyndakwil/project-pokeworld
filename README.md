# Project Pokeworld
A multiplayer Pokemon engine (to be MMO) that runs right in your browser!

## Usage
To play the stable version of Project Pokeworld, simply open http://project-pokeworld.rshetty.repl.co in your browser. Phaser and Socket will handle the rest.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute to this project, download or clone to your computer and make edits as needed. You will need to run the project through a web server as that is the only way Phaser can run (it is held back by strict mode).

You will need to start a pull request in order to merge, but feel free to fork this project if you like!

Remember: This project is not hosted on Github. The 100% confirmed stable version is on http://project-pokeworld.rshetty.repl.co .
