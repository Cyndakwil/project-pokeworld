# Project Pokeworld
A multiplayer Pokemon engine (to be MMO) that runs right in your browser!

## Usage
To play the stable version of Project Pokeworld, simply open http://project-pokeworld.rshetty.repl.co in your browser. Phaser and Socket will handle the rest.

## Contributing

You will need to start a pull request in order to merge, but feel free to fork this project if you like!

Remember: This project is not hosted on Github. The 100% confirmed stable version is on http://project-pokeworld.rshetty.repl.co .

### Code
If you wish to contribute code to this project, download or clone to your computer and make edits as needed. You will need to run the project through a web server as that is the only way Phaser can run (it is held back by strict mode).

### Art
We are always looking for pixel artists to contribute something so that we're always prepared with the spritesheets, tilemaps, etc. that we need to make new additions to the game. All art should be in the Pokemon Black/White style. Tilemaps and spritesheet should have 16x16 frames with <strong>no margin and no spacing.</strong>

### Servers
In order to keep the game running at all times, we are looking to have multiple servers and route players to the nearest one. If you have a spare server with Node.js in an unmentioned location in the list below, please submit it and we can speed test it on the game. Ideally, we would have multiple servers per continent in case one goes down. Socket.io's requirements for this game are minimal.

#### Existing Servers
* (Cyndakwil) Repl.it temp server - varying locations

We really appreciate your contributions, whatever they may be!
